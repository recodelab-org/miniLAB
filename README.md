# miniLAB
A ridiculously simple WordPress theme by Enno Hyttrek.

Version: a.1.1.6

The current version is absolutely work-in-progress. It is only the minimal shell for a WordPress theme to function. There are no separate PHP template parts, as WP themes usually have. This probably won't change. One objective of this project is to create a theme that accomplishes everything with just the index.php as a template. This might fail or lead nowhere, but if so, so be it.
